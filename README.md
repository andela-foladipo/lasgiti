# Welcome to Lasgiti!
It's pretty simple: this is an Android app that shows you GitHub users that have
Java repositories AND are resident in Lagos, Nigeria.

## How to build the app
The following steps are needed to build this app.
* A recent version of Android Studio. If you don't have this, head over to
[this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to install
it and its dependencies.
* If you have Git installed on your computer, open a terminal/command prompt and
clone this repo with this command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maviza101/lasgiti.git
```
If you can't do the above, go to [this link](https://github.com/Maviza101/lasgiti),
download this repo as a ZIP file and extract it.
* Start Android Studio. Using the toolbar at the top of the window, go to `File > Open...`
and navigate to where you saved the repo from the steps above. Choose that directory/folder
(it should be named "lasgiti").
* That's it! You can either run the app in an emulator on your computer (using Shift + F10)
or you can build an APK and install it on your Android device.
